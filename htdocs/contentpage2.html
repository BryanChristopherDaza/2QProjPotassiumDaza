		         As to how beautiful the game sounds at the beginning, 
		    	 it’s not the situation right now.

		         On August 30, 2021, MiHoYo posted the anniversary
		         rewards of the game on their Facebook page.
				 Although anniversary rewards, in general, are
				 often exciting and big, it was not the case for
				 Genshin Impact.

		         The main rewards of the anniversary were 10

				 Intertwined Fates, which is used for wishing
			     for the characters on the gacha system in the
				 game, along with a couple of web events.
				 Unfortunately, the people of the community
				 were unsatisfied with the rewards, because
				 they were too low, considering the amount of
				 popularity the game has and the probability
				 of getting their desired characters. The
				 anticipated rewards of the players were a
				 free 5-star of their choice. Despite this,
				 the people of the community still had hope
				 and faith in the company, thinking that there
				 will be last minute-surprise anniversary
				 awards at the date of the anniversary,
				 which is September 28.

		        This hope did not last long though, as MiHoYo hasn’t
			    said anything about the anniversary awards since then.
			    People have been discussing the anniversary controversy,
			    and different predictions/assumptions came up. Some
			   people think that it has something to do with the new
			    Chinese law, which states that people under 18 years
			    old can only play video games for one hour at weekends.
			   This was instantly rejected by the community. The
			    assumption that most people believed in is that there
			   will be last-minute surprise rewards on the day of the
		    	anniversary, which is the most logical assumption they
		    	would’ve made.

		         The day of the anniversary came, but unfortunately
				 for the community, there were no surprise rewards
				 from the game. This is when the people of the
				 community raged and did various kinds of things.
