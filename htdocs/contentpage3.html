        <h1>The Consequences</h1>
        <article>
			As mentioned in the last part, no surprise rewards
            were given to the people of the community. Since
			the rewards did not meet the expectations of the
			players of the game, many people started to do
			various things in order for MiHoYo to give better
			rewards. One of them was the 1-star rating tantrum
			at Google Play Store.

			Many angry players decided to rate the game with 1

			star because of the lack of anniversary rewards.
			This then resulted in the lowest star rating the
			game has experienced so far. Although there are
			still people who defend MiHoYo, it was not as
			dominant as the unsatisfied players. The rating of
		    the game in Google Play Store got as low as 1.9
			stars, compared to the previous rating of 4.5
			stars. People began to talk about this as some
			people were afraid that the game will be deleted
			if the star rating is low enough, which is not true.

		<article>
		    Although this seems like an immature way to pursue
			MiHoYo on giving the players more rewards for the
			anniversary, it makes some sense. 10 Intertwined
		    Fates is a very little number of fates, considering
			that a guaranteed limited 5-star character
			(highest rarity) takes 180 Intertwined Fates.
			The web events mentioned earlier consisted of a
			raffle in which 10% of the players who join that
			raffle get a Blessing of the Welkin Moon (a
			purchase you can make in the game to get rewards),
			which is equal to 2700 Primogems, which is just
			enough to get 16 Intertwined Fates. Considering you
			won the raffle, along with the anniversary rewards,
			it would still be only 26 wishes, which is just
			barely more than 1/9 the number of Intertwined Fates
			you need to get a guaranteed limited 5-star character.
			Although 180 Intertwined Fates is the number of Fates
			that will guarantee you a limited 5-star character,
			it is unlikely to get to such a high number. To know
			more about this, watch the video below.

			Another thing the players did was messaging MiHoYo
			through various kinds of social media, like Discord,

			Reddit, etc. with messages about their “greed”.
			Their official discord server got spammed with Qiqi
			(an in-game playable character who is technically
			a zombie) stickers, which symbolize “Game is dead”.
			Of course, MiHoYo didn’t stay silent.
